# AnkiFetchPronunciation
I love learning languages and because of this I am constantly learning new words on Anki. When learning new words, I love to also hear the pronouciation but doing this by hand on Forvo takes a lot of time. I created this add-on so that I can automatically fetch all pronouciations of words in my deck with a simple click of a button.
